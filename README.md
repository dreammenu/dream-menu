# Dream Menu website

The files for www.dream-menu.com. Vercel deploys this repository: anything merged to `main` goes live.

- Public pages and the venue map sit at the top level.
- The partner area, report sections and partner data are protected by `middleware.js`, which checks the `DM_PASSWORD` environment variable set in Vercel. The password is not stored here.
- `dm-data.js`, `dm-cat.js` and `dm-labels.js` hold the venue data, the refined dish categories and the plain labels with parent groups.
- `partner-data.js` holds the partner briefing data; `partner/render.js` draws the briefing, insights and one-pager from it, and `partner/downloads.js` builds the CSV downloads in the browser.
